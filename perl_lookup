Notes on using perl (quick reference in the future): 

#qw(A B): This function is a quick way to specify a lot of little single-quoted words. For example, qw(foo bar baz) is equivalent to ('foo', 'bar', 'baz'). 

#strings can be used to join together via join(), eg: 
join("<separateSymbol", "a", "b" ); 

# Compile program without running it, quick validation on syntaxes
perl -c abc.pl 

# Compile with warning 
perl -w abc.pl 

# Run with perl debugger 
perl -d abc.pl
