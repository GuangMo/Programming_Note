##### Dynamic Programming
Overview: 
repeatedly calculation, with some of previous results saved in a table, which 
avoid duplicated calculations. 
- an example of time-memory trade-off 


Optimal substructure: optimal solutions to a problem incorporate optimal solutions to related subproblems, which may be solved independently. 

Two equivalent ways to implement a dynamic-programming approach: 

Approach #1: top-down with memoization
- saves results, and checks if subproblem has been solved

Approach #2: bottom-up method 
- depends on some natural notion of the "size" of a subproblem


##### End of dynamic programming
