#########################Notes on big data##################


### Mapreduce algorithms ### 
1.Map function
2.Shuffle:  categorize entries 
3. Reduce

##### Framework to solve problems ### 
1. Deals with fault tolerance 
2. assign workers to map and reduce tasks 
3. Moves processes to data 
4. Shuffles and sorts intermedia data 
5. deals with errors. 

---- the whole concept is similar to MPP


###### HADOOP introduction ##### 
- designed to work on cheap, unreliable clusters
- From the onset, designed to scale 

# Two key aspects of HADOOP # 
1. MapReduce framework 

2. Hadoop Distributed File System = HDFS 
{
   - data needs to be stroed on multiple machines 
   - 
}
