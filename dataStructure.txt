## Note on data structures

#################
### Binary Search Tree: 
### - each node has: key, pointers to left, right, and parent 

# Properties: 
For all nodes in the left subtree of x: 
  key[y] <= key[x] 
For all nodes in the right subtree of x: 
  key[y] >= key[x] 

# Objective: sort. Inorder-walk 
Running time of inorder-walk: O(n), each link is traversed twice 

# Operations:
Insert(x) 
Delete(x) 
Search(k) 
Successor(x): the next greater value than x
